#+TITLE: AsciiDoc Syntax Quick Reference
#+NAME: AsciiDoc
#+COMMAND: adoc
# Converted from asciidoctor quick syntax reference: https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor.org

* About
AsciiDoc is a lightweight markup language for authoring notes, articles, documentation, books, web pages, slide decks and man pages in plain text.
This guide is a quick reference for the common AsciiDoc document and text formatting markup.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
These examples focus on the output generated by the HTML backend.
AsciiDoc produces complementary output when generating PDF, EPUB, and DocBook.

Most features labeled _Asciidoctor only_ can be made available to the legacy AsciiDoc Python processor by using [[uri-config][this AsciiDoc configuration file]] provided by the Asciidoctor project.
#+END_QUOTE

* Paragraphs
** Normal
#+BEGIN_SRC adoc
Paragraphs don't require any special markup in AsciiDoc.
A paragraph is just one or more lines of consecutive text.

To begin a new paragraph, separate it by at least one blank line.
Newlines within a paragraph are not displayed.
#+END_SRC

** Literal
#+BEGIN_SRC adoc
A normal paragraph.

A paragraph offset by at least one space becomes a literal paragraph.
All lines in a literal paragraph must be adjacent.

A literal paragraph is displayed as preformatted text.
The text is shown in a fixed-width font.
Spaces and newlines,
like the ones in this sentence,
are preserved.

Another normal paragraph.
#+END_SRC

** Admonition
#+BEGIN_SRC adoc
NOTE: An admonition paragraph draws the reader's attention to
auxiliary information.
Its purpose is determined by the label
at the beginning of the paragraph.

Here are the other built-in admonition types:

TIP: Pro tip...

IMPORTANT: Don't forget...

WARNING: Watch out for...

CAUTION: Ensure that...
#+END_SRC

NOTE: You can also create [[admon-bl][admonition blocks]].

** Lead paragraph
#+BEGIN_SRC adoc
[.lead]
This text will be styled as a lead paragraph (i.e., larger font).
#+END_SRC

NOTE: The default Asciidoctor stylesheet automatically styles the first paragraph of the preamble as a lead paragraph.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE

#+END_QUOTE

* Formatted Text
** Bold, Italic, and Monospace
#+BEGIN_SRC adoc
bold *constrained* & **un**constrained

italic _constrained_ & __un__constrained

bold italic *_constrained_* & **__un__**constrained

monospace ~constrained~ & `~un~`constrained

monospace bold `*constrained*` & ``**un**``constrained

monospace italic `_constrained_` & ``__un__``constrained

monospace bold italic `*_constrained_*` & ``**__un__**``constrained
#+END_SRC

** Monospace vs codespan
#+BEGIN_SRC adoc
`{cpp}` is valid syntax in the programming language by the same name.

`+WHERE id <= 20 AND value = "{name}"+` is a SQL WHERE clause.
#+END_SRC

NOTE: The meaning of backtick (`pass:[`]`) and plus (`+`) changed in Asciidoctor 1.5.0.
Backticks only make the text monospaced, whereas pluses passthrough text without applying formatting.
See the <<migration.adoc#,migration page>> for details.

** Marks and Custom Styling
#+BEGIN_SRC adoc
Werewolves are allergic to #cassia cinnamon#.

Did the werewolves read the [.small]#small print#?

Where did all the [.underline]#cores# run off to?

We need [.line-through]#ten# make that twenty VMs.

[.big]##O##nce upon an infinite loop.
#+END_SRC

** Superscript and Subscript
#+BEGIN_SRC adoc
^super^script phrase

~sub~script phrase
#+END_SRC

** Curved Quotation Marks and Apostrophes (Smart Quotes)
#+BEGIN_SRC adoc
"`double curved quotes`"

'`single curved quotes`'

Olaf's desk was a mess.

All of the werewolves`' desks were a mess.

Olaf had been with the company since the `'60s.

#+END_QUOTE

* Document Header

IMPORTANT: A header is optional.

CAUTION: The header may not contain blank lines and must be offset from the content by at least one blank line.

** Title only
#+BEGIN_SRC adoc
= My Document's Title

My document provides...
#+END_SRC

** Title and author line
#+BEGIN_SRC adoc
= My Document's Title
Doc Writer <doc.writer@asciidoctor.org>

My document provides...
#+END_SRC

TIP: Asciidoctor allows multiple authors in the author line.
Use the semi-colon character to separate each author.

** Title, author line and revision line
#+BEGIN_SRC adoc
include::{includedir}/ex-rev.adoc[tag=b-base]
#+END_SRC

IMPORTANT: You cannot have a revision line without an author line.

** Document header with attributes
#+BEGIN_SRC adoc
= My Document's Title
Doc Writer <doc.writer@asciidoctor.org>
v1.0, 2014-01-01

My document provides...
#+END_SRC

* Section Titles (Headings)
** Article doctype
#+BEGIN_SRC adoc
= Document Title (Level 0)

== Level 1 Section Title

=== Level 2 Section Title

==== Level 3 Section Title

===== Level 4 Section Title

====== Level 5 Section Title

== Another Level 1 Section Title
#+END_SRC



WARNING: When using the article doctype (the default), you can only have one level-0 section title (i.e., the document title) and it must be in the document header.

NOTE: The number of equal signs matches the heading level in the HTML output.
For example, _Section Level 1_ becomes an `<h2>` heading.

** Book doctype
#+BEGIN_SRC adoc
include::{includedir}/ex-section.adoc[tag=book]
#+END_SRC



////
IMPORTANT: There are two other ways to define a section title.
_Their omission is intentional_.
They both require more markup and are therefore unnecessary.
The https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Setext[setext] title syntax (underlined text) is especially wasteful, hard to remember, hard to maintain and error prone.
The reader never sees the extra markup, so why type it?
*Be frugal!*
////

** Explicit id
#+BEGIN_SRC adoc
[#primitives-nulls]
== Primitive types and null values
#+END_SRC

** Section anchors and links (Asciidoctor only)
~sectanchors~
When this document attribute is set, a section icon anchor appears in front of the section title.

~sectlinks~
When this document attribute is set, the section titles become self-links.
This enables a reader to bookmark the section.

NOTE: Section title anchors depend on the default Asciidoctor stylesheet to render properly.

* Include Files
** Document parts
#+BEGIN_SRC adoc
= Reference Documentation
Lead Developer

This is documentation for project X.

include::basics.adoc[]

include::installation.adoc[]

include::example.adoc[]
#+END_SRC

CAUTION: Asciidoctor does not insert blank lines between adjacent include statements to keep the content separated.
Be sure to add a blank line in the source document to avoid unexpected results, such as a section title being swallowed.

** Include content from a URI
#+BEGIN_SRC adoc
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/master/README.adoc[]
#+END_SRC

NOTE: Including content from a URI is potentially dangerous, so it's disabled if the safe mode is SECURE or greater.
Assuming the safe mode is less than SECURE, you must also set the ~allow-uri-read~ attribute to permit Asciidoctor to read content from a URI.

* Breaks
** Hard line break
#+BEGIN_SRC adoc
Rubies are red, +
Topazes are blue.

[%hardbreaks]
Ruby is red.
Java is black.
#+END_SRC

** Thematic break (aka horizontal rule)
#+BEGIN_SRC adoc

'''

after
#+END_SRC

** Page break
#+BEGIN_SRC adoc

#+END_SRC

* Lists
** Unordered, basic 
   # Indented to avoid breaking structure
   #+BEGIN_SRC adoc
   * Edgar Allen Poe
   * Sheri S. Tepper
   * Bill Bryson
  #+END_SRC

** Unordered, basic (alt)
#+BEGIN_SRC adoc
- Edgar Allen Poe
- Sheri S. Tepper
- Bill Bryson
#+END_SRC

NOTE: A blank line is required before and after a list to separated it from other blocks.

TIP: You can force two adjacent lists apart by inserting a blank line followed by a line comment after the first list.
The convention is to use `//-` as the line comment to provide a hint to other authors that it's a list divider.

** Unordered, max nesting
   # Indented to avoid breaking structure
    #+BEGIN_SRC adoc
    * level 1
    ** level 2
    *** level 3
    **** level 4
    ***** level 5
    * level 1
    #+END_SRC

TIP: The unordered list marker can be changed using [[uri-marker][block styles]].

** Ordered, basic
#+BEGIN_SRC adoc
. Step 1
. Step 2
. Step 3
#+END_SRC

NOTE: You can choose to include an ordinal in front of each list marker, but they have to be in sequence.

** Ordered, nested
#+BEGIN_SRC adoc

    +
    list continuation:: a plus sign (`{plus}`) on a line by itself

    * A literal paragraph does not require a list continuation.

    $ gem install asciidoctor

#+END_SRC

NOTE: Links with attributes (including the subject and body segments on mailto links) are a feature unique to Asciidoctor.
To enable them prior to 1.5.7, you must set the ~linkattrs~ attribute on the document.
Since 1.5.7, attribute parsing is enabled automatically if an equal sign follows a comma.
When attribute parsing is enabled, you must quote the link text if it contains a comma.

** Inline anchors
#+BEGIN_SRC adoc
[[bookmark-a]]Inline anchors make arbitrary content referenceable.

[#bookmark-b]#Inline anchors can be applied to a phrase like this one.#

anchor:bookmark-c[]Use a cross reference to link to this location.

[[bookmark-d,last paragraph]]The xreflabel attribute will be used as link text in the cross-reference link.
#+END_SRC

** Internal cross references
#+BEGIN_SRC adoc

Learn how to organize the document into <<section-titles,sections>>.
#+END_SRC

** Inter-document cross references (Asciidoctor only)
#+BEGIN_SRC adoc
Refer to <<document-b.adoc#section-b,Section B>> for more information.

See you when you get back from <<document-b#section-b,Section B>>!
#+END_SRC

* Images
Images are resolved relative to the value of the [[uri-imagesdir][imagesdir]] document attribute, which is empty by default.
You are encouraged to make use of the ~imagesdir~ attribute to avoid hard-coding the common path to your images in every image macro.

The ~imagesdir~ attribute can be an absolute path, relative path, or base URL.
When the image target is a URL or absolute path, the imagesdir prefix is *not* prepended.

** Block
#+BEGIN_SRC adoc
image::sunset.jpg[]

image::sunset.jpg[Sunset]

[#img-sunset]
[caption="Figure 1: ",link=https://www.flickr.com/photos/javh/5448336655]

** Inline
#+BEGIN_SRC adoc
Click image:icons/play.png[Play, title="Play"] to get the party started.

Click image:icons/pause.png[title="Pause"] when you need a break.
#+END_SRC

IMPORTANT: Two colons following the image keyword in the macro (i.e., `image::`) indicates a block image (aka figure), whereas one colon following the image keyword (i.e., `image:`) indicates an inline image.
(All macros follow this pattern).
You use an inline image when you need to place the image in a line of text.
Otherwise, you should prefer the block form.

** Inline image with positioning role
#+BEGIN_SRC adoc
image:sunset.jpg[Sunset,150,150,role="right"] What a beautiful sunset!
#+END_SRC

TIP: There are a variety of attributes available to [[uri-image-attrs][position and frame images]].

** Embedded
#+BEGIN_SRC adoc
= Document Title
:data-uri:
#+END_SRC

NOTE: When the ~data-uri~ attribute is set, all images in the document--including admonition icons--are embedded into the document as [[uri-data-uri][data URIs]].

TIP: Instead of declaring the ~data-uri~ attribute in the document, you can pass it as a command-line argument using `-a data-uri`.

* Videos

.AsciiDoc history
****
AsciiDoc was first released in Nov 2002 by Stuart Rackham.
It was designed from the start to be a shorthand syntax
for producing professional documents like DocBook and LaTeX.
****
#+END_SRC

NOTE: Any block can have a title, positioned above the block.
A block title is a line of text that starts with a dot.
The dot cannot be followed by a space.

** Example
#+BEGIN_SRC adoc
.Sample document
====
Here's a sample AsciiDoc document:

[listing]

#+END_SRC

** Admonition and callout icons
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Asciidoctor can "draw" icons using {uri-fontawesome}[Font Awesome^] and CSS.

To use this feature, set the value of the ~icons~ document attribute to ~font~.
Asciidoctor will then emit HTML markup that selects an appropriate font character from the Font Awesome font for each admonition block.

Icons can also be used [[uri-icon-in][inline]] and [[uri-icon-attrs][styled]].

When the cells in the header are not defined on a single line, you must use the ~cols~ attribute to set the number of columns in the table and the `%header` option (or `options=header` attribute) to promote the first row to the table header.

** Attribute assignment precedence (highest to lowest)
- Attribute passed to the API or CLI that does not end in ~@~
- Attribute defined in the document
- Attribute passed to the API or CLI that ends in ~@~
- Intrinsic attribute value (default values)

TIP: To make an attribute value that is passed to the API or CLI have a lower precedence than an assignment in the document, add an ~@~ symbol to the end of the attribute value.

⁠^{[1]} Some replacements are Unicode characters, whereas others are numeric character references (e.g., \&#34;).
These character references are used whenever the use of the Unicode character could interfere with the AsciiDoc syntax or confuse the renderer (i.e., the browser).
It's up to the converter to transform the reference into something the renderer understands (something both the man page and PDF converter handle).

⁠^{[2]} Asciidoctor does not prevent you from reassigning predefined attributes.
However, it's best to treat them as read-only unless the output format requires the use of a different encoding scheme.
These attributes are an effective tool for decoupling content and presentation.

⁠^{[3]} Asciidoctor allows you to use any of the named character references (aka named entities) defined in HTML (e.g., \&euro; resolves to &euro;).
However, using named character references can cause problems when generating non-HTML output such as PDF because the lookup table needed to resolve these names may not be defined.
Our recommendation is avoid using named character references--with the exception of those defined in XML (i.e., lt, gt, amp, quot and apos).
Instead, use numeric character references (e.g., \&#8364;).

⁠^{[4]} The Zero Width Space (ZWSP) is a code point in Unicode that shows where a long word can be split if necessary.

⁠^{[5]} The word joiner (WJ) is a code point in Unicode that prevents a line break at its position.

<<note-docdatetime>>^{[1]} Only reflects the last modified time of the source document file.
It does not consider the last modified time of files which are included.

<<note-sourcedateepoch>>^{[2]} If the SOURCE\under{}DATE\under{}EPOCH environment variable is set, the value assigned to this attribute is built from a UTC date object that corresponds to the timestamp (as an integer) stored in that environment variable.
This override offers one way to make the conversion reproducible.
See https://reproducible-builds.org/specs/source-date-epoch/ for more information about the SOURCE\under{}DATE\under{}EPOCH environment variable.
Otherwise, the date is expressed in the local time zone, which is reported as a time zone offset (e.g., ~-0600~) or UTC if the time zone offset is 0).
To force the use of UTC, set the ~TZ=UTC~ environment variable when invoking Asciidoctor.

<<note-outfilesuffix>>^{[3]} ~.html~ for ~html~, ~.xml~ for ~docbook~, etc. The value is not updated to match the file extension of the output file when one is specified explicitly.

* Escaping Text
** Backslash
#+BEGIN_SRC adoc
\*Stars* is not rendered as bold text.
The asterisks around the word are preserved.

\{author} is not resolved to the author name.
The curly brackets around the word are preserved.

`A\--Z` connects A to Z in monospace using two dashes.
The dashes are not replaced by an em dash.

\[[Word]] is not interpreted as an anchor.
The double brackets around the word are preserved.

[\[[Word]]] is not interpreted as a bibliography anchor.
The triple brackets around the word are preserved.

In these cases, the backslash character is automatically removed.
